# Shooting Arena - Co-location Multiplayer Game

A Meta Quest mixed reality arena shooter where 2+ players in the same physical room can see and shoot each other. Built with Unity 6, Photon Fusion 2, and Meta XR SDK.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

**A co-located arena shooting game where players in the same physical space share a coordinate system via spatial anchors and compete in fast-paced combat.**

### Design Philosophy
- **Open Play Area Mode**: Players spawn at their physical headset position (no teleportation needed)
- **Co-location First**: Shared spatial anchors ensure all players see the same virtual content in the same physical space
- **Minimal Scope**: Focus on core shooting mechanics before adding voice chat, power-ups, etc.

## 🐛 Known Issues & Troubleshooting

### Players Don't See Each Other
1. Verify both devices completed Space Setup in the same room
2. Check both devices are on the same WiFi network
3. Verify Photon App ID is configured correctly
4. Check console for Fusion connection errors
5. Ensure `AvatarMovementHandlerMotif` is syncing positions

### Bullets Don't Do Damage
1. Verify `BulletMotif` prefab has a collider set as trigger
2. Check avatar has collider for hit detection
3. Verify `TakeDamageRpc` is being called (add debug logs)
4. Ensure bullet's `OwnerPlayer` is set correctly (no self-damage)

### Game Doesn't Start
1. Check `ShootingGameManagerMotif.m_minPlayersToStart` (default: 2)
2. Verify players are registered via `RegisterPlayer()`
3. Check game state in Inspector while running

### Co-location Not Aligning
1. Both devices must have completed **Space Setup** (room scan)
2. Verify host creates anchor (`SharedSpatialAnchorManager` logs)
3. Verify client discovers anchor (check discovery logs)
4. Ensure `ColocationManager.AlignUserToAnchor()` is called
5. Check calibration error isn't too high

### Performance Issues
1. Reduce bullet lifetime (`ShootingPlayerMotif.m_bulletLifetime`)
2. Increase fire rate cooldown (`ShootingPlayerMotif.m_fireRate`)
3. Check for excessive debug logging

## 📚 Architecture Deep Dive

### Game State Machine
```
WAITING_FOR_PLAYERS
    ↓ (2+ players connected)
COUNTDOWN (3 seconds)
    ↓
PLAYING
    ↓ (player reaches kill target OR timer expires)
ROUND_END (show winner, 10 sec delay)
    ↓ (auto-restart OR hold both grips)
WAITING_FOR_PLAYERS
```

### Co-location Flow
```
1. Host creates OVRSpatialAnchor at headset position
2. Host saves anchor and gets UUID
3. Host advertises session via OVRColocationSession
4. Client discovers nearby session
5. Client loads anchor using shared UUID
6. ColocationManager aligns client's camera rig to anchor
7. All players now share identical world coordinates
```

### Networking Architecture (Fusion 2 Shared Mode)
```
NetworkRunner (Shared Mode)
├── Auto Matchmaking → Players auto-join same session
├── Host = State Authority for game state
├── Each player = Input Authority for their avatar
├── [Networked] properties → Auto-synced values
├── RPCs → For events (damage, game state changes)
└── Host Migration → Seamless takeover if host leaves
```

### Open Play Area Spawning
```
1. Player connects to Fusion session
2. SpawnManagerMotif.GetSpawnLocation() returns headset position
3. Avatar spawns at physical location (no teleportation)
4. Player is already "there" - no movement needed
```

---

## ❌ Explicitly Out of Scope (Not MVP)

- Voice chat (removed Photon Voice dependency)
- Predefined spawn points (using open play area)
- Seeing other players' health bars overhead
- Weapon pickups on the ground
- Environment destruction
- AI opponents

---

## 🔮 Future Architecture: Server-Authoritative with Global Anchors

> **Branch for implementation:** `feature/server-authoritative-anchors`

### Current Approach
- Each headset aligns to a **shared spatial anchor** via colocation
- Avatar positions are synced **relative to an "object of interest"**
- All game logic runs on headsets via Photon Fusion (Shared Mode)

### Proposed Architecture

**1. Global Anchor(s) as Reference Frame**
- More stable reference point, less drift over time
- Multiple anchors for larger play areas (>3m from single anchor causes drift)
- Better for persistent/long-running sessions
- Pre-placed physical anchor markers (QR codes or known positions)

**2. Local Server as Master Handler**
- Offloads processing from headsets (tracking sync, game state, hit detection)
- Better for longer runs - headsets thermal throttle over time
- Single source of truth - less sync conflicts
- Could run on a laptop, Raspberry Pi, or cloud server

```

### Key Technologies for Implementation
- **Photon Fusion Server Mode** instead of Shared Mode
- **Dedicated Server Build** running game logic
- **Pre-placed physical anchor markers** (QR codes or known positions)
- **Meta's Space Sharing API** for room-scale anchor sharing

### Trade-offs
| Aspect | Current (Shared Mode) | Future (Server Mode) |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Latency | Lower (peer-to-peer) | Higher (server round-trip) |
| Headset Load | Higher | Lower |
| Drift Handling | Per-session | Persistent calibration |
| Scalability | 2-8 players | Many players |
| Infrastructure | None | Server required |
