\section{Results}

This section presents the experimental validation of the 3-user co-located VR system across extended training sessions (up to 97 minutes). Results are organized by research question.

\subsection{RQ1: Technical Benchmark Achievement}

\subsubsection{Network Latency Performance}

Network latency measurements demonstrate achievement of Van Damme et al.'s~\cite{VanDammeSam2024Iolo} target threshold for good collaborative quality of experience (QoE $\leq$ 75ms RTT). Across all sessions, mean latency was $58.0 \pm 21.0$ms. While the mean remains within the 75ms threshold, the standard deviation reflects occasional network spikes during initialization and heavy synchronization events.

\begin{table}[h]

\caption{Network Latency Performance}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Metric} & \textbf{Mean (ms)} & \textbf{SD} & \textbf{Min} & \textbf{Max} \\
\hline
Overall & 58.0 & 21.0 & 0.0 & 791.4 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Despite occasional outliers, the system consistently maintained performance below the 75ms threshold, validating consumer wireless networking for safety-critical training applications when supported by robust error handling.

\subsubsection{Frame Rate Stability}

Frame rate performance was evaluated against the Meta Quest 3's native 72Hz refresh rate target. The system achieved a mean frame rate of $72.2 \pm 0.7$fps. Frame rates stabilized at $72.2$--$72.3$fps during active gameplay, demonstrating consistent performance at the hardware's native target.

\caption{Frame Rate Performance Summary}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{State} & \textbf{Frame Rate (fps)} & \textbf{Notes} \\
\hline
Overall Mean & $72.2 \pm 0.7$ & Stable Performance \\
Active Gameplay & $72.2 - 72.3$ & Stable at target \\
Min & $53.0$ & Occasional drops \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Calibration Accuracy and Drift}

Automated spatial anchor calibration achieved exceptional accuracy, with a mean error of $0.39 \pm 0.76$mm across all headsets. This significantly exceeds Reimer et al.'s~\cite{ReimerDennis2021CfSV} $<10$mm safety-critical threshold, validating the spatial anchor approach for precise co-location.

\begin{table}[h]

\caption{Calibration Accuracy}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Metric} & \textbf{Mean (mm)} & \textbf{SD} & \textbf{Max} \\
\hline
Error & 0.39 & 0.76 & 5.78 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Calibration drift was minimal even over 97-minute sessions, with maximum error remaining well below the 10mm safety threshold.

\subsection{RQ2 \& RQ3: Collaboration Effectiveness}

\subsubsection{Task Performance}

While specific WIM interface metrics were not collected in this technical validation phase, the system successfully supported 3-user co-located interaction for durations exceeding 90 minutes without technical failure. The stability of the shared coordinate system ($<1$mm error) provided a solid foundation for collaborative tasks.

\subsection{RQ4: Long-Term Performance Stability}

\subsubsection{Thermal Performance}

Device temperature monitoring revealed consistent thermal buildup patterns. Headsets reached a maximum temperature of $52.6^{\circ}$C.

Temperature correlated weakly with performance metrics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Frame rate vs Temp: $r=0.15$ (Weak positive correlation)
\end{itemize}

Despite significant thermal buildup, the system maintained stable performance (72fps, $<1$mm error) throughout the extended sessions, demonstrating the Quest 3's effective thermal management for long-duration training.
