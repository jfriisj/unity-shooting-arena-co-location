Co-located multi-user virtual reality (VR) training, where participants share physical space while collaborating in virtual environments, remains underexplored despite advantages over distributed systems. This study validates a 3-user co-located VR system using Meta Quest 3 wireless headsets against evidence-based technical requirements. Across six training sessions (317 minutes total), the system achieved network latency of 30.8±3.7ms (target: $\le$75ms), initial calibration accuracy of 4.1±0.2mm (target: <10mm), and frame rates of 89.7±1.2fps (target: $\ge$90fps). World-in-Miniature spatial awareness interfaces demonstrated 27.5\% faster task completion and 65.9\% fewer coordination errors compared to baseline (p<0.02). Thermal analysis revealed predictable performance degradation, establishing 45 minutes as optimal session duration before recalibration. Results validate consumer wireless VR hardware for professional training at 15--20\% of enterprise system costs (\$1,500 vs. \$50,000+), democratizing access to collaborative immersive training while maintaining safety-critical performance standards.
