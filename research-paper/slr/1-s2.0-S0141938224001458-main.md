Exocentric views play a pivotal role in computer-mediated collaboration, especially in Collaborative Virtual
Environments (CVEs), where focusing on the actions and operations of collaboration partners is crucial. The
exocentric perspective offers users a vantage point to ascertain the whereabouts and actions of their partners,
enhancing spatial awareness and social presence in CVEs. Moreover, interacting via the Exocentric Perspective
Interface (ExPI) can help users complete searching and manipulation tasks remotely and efficiently. This work
investigates the potential benefits of two representative ExPIs, World In Miniature (WIM) and 2D Map, for
VR collaboration. We conducted a user study with 36 participants (18 pairs) to compare WIM and the 2D
Map against a baseline in a VR collaborative task encompassing a series of searching and manipulation tasks
with different task complexities (Simple, Medium, and Complex). For the Baseline (BL) condition, participants
were not provided with an Exocentric Perspectives Interface (ExPI) but instead were given a map of the
virtual environment (VE). The results indicate that these two ExPIs significantly improved task performance,
usability, social presence, and user experience while reducing VR sickness. In addition, we also found that
WIM outperformed 2D Maps, especially in complex collaborative environments. Based on the findings, three
design implications are proposed to guide the design of future VR collaboration systems.
1. Introduction
Virtual Reality (VR) technology immerses users in computer-
generated three-dimensional (3D) environments using Head-Mounted
Displays (HMDs) and other supporting equipment, such as trackers.
Collaborative Virtual Environments (CVEs) are VR platforms that allow
multiple users to interact and collaborate in a shared virtual space,
fostering teamwork and improved performance [1–3]. However, the
expansive nature of CVEs in VR often poses many challenges, partic-
ularly in reducing spatial awareness. Spatial awareness, the insight
users accrue over time regarding their environment or workspace,
decreases as the environment expands, which would confuse and
overload users [4]. A notable repercussion of this is the diminished
social presence. If collaborators are out of users’ vicinity, users lack a
feeling of social presence—the sense of being with others [5,6]. Social
presence stands as a cornerstone in collaborative endeavors. It enables

efficient communication and a fluid workflow, positively impacting
task performance and user experience in collaborative scenarios [7–9].
Employing an exocentric perspective that displays the entire VR
scene could provide users with spatial awareness cues, aiding in dis-
cerning the positions and actions of their collaborators. This knowledge
can enhance social presence [10]. Researchers have proposed sev-
eral techniques to provide exocentric perspectives. World In Miniature
(WIM) [11] is a visual technique that provides an exocentric perspec-
tive with a miniaturized version of the virtual world, allowing users
to observe and travel efficiently in the Virtual Environment (VE). The
utility of WIM has been extensively explored, particularly in tasks
involving navigation and locomotion within VR. For example, Berger
et al. [12] uncovered that WIM significantly outpaced continuous
motion and teleportation, two prevalent VR locomotion techniques, in
scenarios of long-distance navigation. In addition to WIM, 2D Map is
another visual tool that provides an exocentric view, presenting a top

view of the VE. Like WIM, most research investigating 2D Maps has
been geared towards aiding self-location and orientation for naviga-
tion [13–15]. However, most research on these two techniques has
focused on single-user tasks and mainly used these tools to project the
VE rather than aid collaboration and interaction. Our review reveals a
notable gap in leveraging WIM or 2D Map for multi-user, collaborative
tasks within VR.
Therefore, this paper aims to bridge this research gap by examining
the potential benefits of two Exocentric Perspective Interfaces (ExPIs),
WIM and 2D Map, to provide spatial awareness cues and interactive op-
erations for visual search and manipulation tasks in VR collaboration.
We hypothesized that,
• H1: Compared to not using an ExPI (i.e., a baseline condition),
WIM and 2D Map would lead to better performance and experi-
ence in terms of the time taken to complete the task (task perfor-
mance), system usability, perceived sense of social presence, and
VR sickness.
• H2: WIM would outperform 2D Map. To confirm this, a user
study was conducted to compare a baseline, 2D Map, and WIM in
different task complexities (Simple, Medium, and Complex) using
a test environment involving visual search and manipulation tasks
in collaborative VR.
The results showed that both ExPIs significantly improved collaborative
performance and experience. Furthermore, WIM led to better perfor-
mance and experience than 2D Map and was more favorable, especially
when the VE had a higher complexity. Our contributions are as follows:
1. A prototype supporting collaborative activities in VR with the
aid of interactive exocentric views — WIM and 2D Map;
2. The results of a user study comparing the two types of interac-
tive exocentric views against baseline condition (the absence of
exocentric views) in collaborative VR scenarios for visual search
and manipulation tasks; and
3. Three implications on the design and use of these exocentric
views for VR collaboration scenarios.
2. Related work
2.1. Exocentric views
There are mainly two exocentric perspective metaphors in VR:
World In Miniature (WIM) and 2D Map. They can provide a shared
perspective to improve collaborators’ understanding of the workspace.
We next discuss these two exocentric perspective metaphors in more
detail.
2.1.1. Word In Miniature (WIM)
WIM was initially proposed by Stoakley et al. [11] to provide an
additional viewport as a 3D map to the VE. The exocentric view is
represented via a scaled-down model attached to a user’s hand. Subse-
quently, many extensions have been explored for the first generation of
WIMs, such as allowing scaling and scrolling [16], automatically opti-
mizing the perspectives [17], handling complexity and occlusions [18],
and integrating multiple levels of visuals into the WIM [19]. Most
focused on object selection, manipulation, and navigation in VEs for
single users [20,21].
Some research has paid attention to WIM in collaboration set-
tings [22,23]. For example, Stafford et al. [24] presented Hand of God
on a WIM, the first collaborative WIM. The tabletop display user had
a god’s eye view of the virtual world and communicated with the VR
users. On the other hand, Irlitti et al. [23] explored the effect of an
exocentric world in miniature visualization in extended reality envi-
ronments. Recently, Zhao et al. [25] developed L-WiM, an interactive
user interface that links multiple WiMs for collaborative astronomical
data exploration tasks. Chheang et al. [26,27] presented the group WiM
system to support a guide for team navigation in VR environments.
From this review, we can see that WIM can support VR users in their
collaborative tasks. However, more research is needed on evaluating
WIM for visual search and manipulating collaborative tasks in VR.
2.1.2. 2D Map
2D Maps have been widely used and explored for navigation and
orientation purposes [28,29]. They provide a top view of the scene
to support a quick search for information. Darken and Sibert [30]
conducted an early study investigating the use of the 2D Map in VR.
They presented users with a 2D overview of the VE, which led to
enhanced navigation and orientation. Subsequently, some researchers
have focused on specific applications and challenges associated with
the 2D Map in VR. For example, Burigat and Chittaro [31] examined
the user experience aspect of the 2D Map. Darken et al. [32] and Ruddle
et al. [33] found that using an overview map improved users’ perfor-
mance of way-finding tasks in VEs. In addition, Sjölinder et al. [34]
found that an overview map helps users better and more precisely
understand the layout of an information space. However, most of these
studies have focused on single-user navigation and orientation tasks.
Some collaborative systems are providing 2D Map aids. For ex-
ample, the Enscape real-time realistic rendering system provides a
mini-map interface supporting teleportation for collaboration [35].
Arkio, a drawing collaborative VR software, uses a virtual camera to
take screenshots as a shared workspace view [35]. However, these
studies only introduced the related systems and interfaces. There is no
evaluation of the effect of using a 2D Map as a collaborative spatial
tool on improving performance and experience. Besides, most 2D Map
aids only provide view functions and exclude direct interaction with
these maps. Schafer et al. [36] presented a radar view technique as
shared representations to provide awareness information in spatial
collaboration tasks. Their follow-up study [37] integrated 2D and 3D
representations in a qualitative study dealing with collaborative tasks
of rearranging furniture in a virtual space. However, this prior work
did not involve VR environments.
Based on the previous work we have reviewed, there is a limited
exploration of the interactive 2D Map in collaborative VR scenarios.
The potential benefits of 2D Map as an interactive exocentric tool to
enhance spatial co-presence awareness and collaborative experience in
VR still need to be explored.
2.2. Spatial awareness and VR sickness
Spatial awareness is broadly defined as the ability to understand
the body’s position relative to its surroundings. Providing exocentric
perspectives to enhance users’ spatial presence to improve collaboration
has been explored and discussed in prior research [11,38,39]. For
example, Leigh et al. [40] proposed using multiple perspectives in
CVEs. In addition to the default view, users could also view the VR
world from an exocentric perspective. Cho et al. [41] developed an
exocentric viewer system that focused on visualizing the state of a slave
robot. Based on this system, the operator could easily recognize the
workspace context. However, we found that these researchers only used
the exocentric perspective as a view tool in a single-user setting. In
addition, they contributed to proposing a new system but did not show
empirical evidence for its usability.
Interacting with the VE from an exocentric view also allows users
to complete tasks effectively. It can also mitigate VR sickness, which
can be caused by the frequent movements and head turns in the
VE [42]. Berger et al. [12] showed that an interactive WIM interface
could reduce the task completion time while causing less VR sickness
compared with other techniques. Liao et al. [43] stated that using
interactive 3D geo-browsers in pedestrian navigation benefited spatial
knowledge acquisition and decision-making. However, they also only
focused on single-user task scenarios. More research is needed on both
interactive and view functions of exocentric views in collaboration.

2.3. Presence
Lee et al. [44] defined presence as a mental state where virtual
objects are perceived as real. IJsselsteijn et al. [45] further divided it
into two categories: spatial presence and social presence. Spatial pres-
ence can be described as the degree to which an individual experiences
presence in the real world rather than the VE [46]. A high sense of
spatial presence means people will not find the difference between the
mediated environment and the physical world. This presence part is
mainly related to the environment’s vividness and spatial properties,
which is not the main point of this paper.
On the other hand, social presence refers to the sense or feeling
of being with someone else or others [47,48]. In the collaborative
context, social presence refers in more detail to the ability of users
to collect and maintain an understanding of their collaborators’ ac-
tions in a shared workspace [49,50]. During collaboration in a shared
environment, it is essential to know where the collaborators are and
what they are doing, such as what object(s) they are interested in or
interacting with [3,51]. When one user moves around or operates some
objects in virtual environments, the collaborators do not understand
others’ spatial position and actions, resulting in a cognitive disconnect
with associated communication [52]. That is, effectively expressing the
users’ intentions and noticing the collaborators’ actions can promote
collaboration performance and improve user experience.
Researchers have proposed valuable techniques to solve this prob-
lem [23,53]. Much research has explored the interaction process, pres-
ence, and awareness by sharing visual cues in collaborative scenarios.
For example, virtual avatars have been explored to represent each
collaborator and increase awareness of others in the shared VE [54]. As
mentioned above, providing exocentric perspectives of the workspace
to give users spatial awareness cues is another solution that should
be noticed to enhance collaboration. However, we found that existing
research only used an exocentric perspective of the workspace as a
non-interactive observational tool. An exocentric perspective tool to
enhance social presence and enable users to interact with it directly in
VR collaboration scenarios has yet to be explored. Therefore, we aim
to fill this gap in this work.
3. Design and implementation
In this section, we introduce two exocentric perspective interfaces
(ExPIs) to improve social presence and provide rapid interaction for
collaborative tasks in VEs, followed by a description of the test environ-
ment and the task we designed for evaluating the proposed interfaces.
3.1. Exocentric Perspective Interfaces (ExPIs)
An ExPI provides a ‘‘God’s eye view’’ of the entire VE—it allows
users to observe the whole scene, including elements and users’ avatars,
with an additional view in real-time. It is also an interactive interface
allowing the user to input operations directly. Any changes made to
the interface will be reflected in the VE. For instance, if a user moves
an object to a new position in ExPI, the corresponding object in VE
will also shift to the new position. In general, the ExPI serves as a
reference frame and a means of interaction. Based on the prior work,
we implemented two interactive visualization variations: WIM and 2D
Map. WIM is a 3D map-like technique that provides a scaled-down VR
scene (see Fig. 1a). In contrast, the 2D Map only provides a top view
of the VE (see Fig. 1b). Next, we introduce the features of the proposed
ExPIs.
Fig. 1. An overview picture of two exocentric perspective interfaces, (a) WIM and (b)
2D Map.
3.1.1. Widget-based tools
In a VR collaborative task, users may be assigned different sub-
tasks in different locations. To support wide usage scenarios, we make
the ExPI ‘‘widget-like’’, mainly shown in three aspects. First, users
have their own interface rather than a shared, fixed-positioned tool.
It ensures that users can use the ExPI anytime and anywhere. Second,
the ExPI is a paralleled interactive component rather than a separate
mode so that users do not have to stop their current task and switch to
a standalone interface for interaction, which enables fluid workflows.
Finally, following the second feature, we allow users to place the ExPI
in front of their viewpoint or pin it to their non-dominant hand. In
the former case, users can translate or rotate the interface to use it
efficiently without blocking their vision. In the latter case, attaching
the interface to their non-dominant hand naturally follows the hand’s
movement.
3.1.2. Synchronous interactions
By providing an exocentric view or perspective, the current state
of the object in VR scenes that needs to pay attention to can be
dynamically provided by the exocentric view in real-time so that the
changes of objects in VR scenes (including targets to be operated and
operators) can be observed in the exocentric view in a time-saving and
labor-saving manner. At the same time, these tools are designed to be
interactable.
Users can directly manipulate objects in WIM or 2D Map with
the raycasting tool, and then the corresponding objects in VR scenes
will be changed synchronously (see Fig. 2). Users can manipulate the
objects in WIM in the same way they interact in the VE. However,
unlike the three-dimensional view provided by WIM, the 2D Map is
a two-dimensional plane (only in an X–Z plane). So manipulating an
object through a 2D Map can only move it on a plane, i.e., it can only
change the 𝑋-axis and 𝑍-axis position of the object. In addition to
users’ operations on the objects in the VE, users’ locomotion behavior
is also synchronized. When a user moves around the VE, his/her avatar
will move simultaneously in all collaborators’ ExPI. This approach was
designed to give users a higher sense of social presence. Users could feel
more connected with the collaborator by observing the avatar in real-
time. The sense of social presence is an essential factor in collaboration
and would affect users’ experience and task performance.
3.2. Point to reveal more information
All spherical objects were uniformly sized (radius = 0.15 m), and
each featured numerical markers on their front sides within the virtual
environment (VE). To enhance the user experience, we implemented
a technique where, upon pointing at a sphere using raycasting, the
object would rotate to expose its front side (marked with a number)
for quick verification. Once the ray moved away from the sphere, the
object would return to its original position.

L. Chen et al.
Fig. 2. The exocentric perspective interface synchronizes the changes in the virtual
environment while the virtual environment also synchronizes the changes in the
exocentric perspective interface. (a) and (b) show a user manipulating an object in
the virtual environment and WIM, respectively; (c) and (d) show the same action for
the virtual environment and 2D Map. The user’s actions are in blue circles, while the
synchronized changes are in yellow circles.
This functionality was also smoothly integrated into the ExPI. Dur-
ing the use of WIM, and especially the 2D Map, there might be a
flattened perspective of the scene, which restricts users’ view to the
top of objects and the surrounding area. Whenever the ray intersected
a sphere on the ExPI, its front side would be exposed to users. Ad-
ditionally, the corresponding sphere in the VR scene would rotate as
well, ensuring that its front side (with the number facing upwards)
was clearly visible. This allowed users to easily identify the number
associated with each sphere, even on the ExPI.
3.3. Test environment
As shown in Fig. 1, the test environment was a 6 m × 6 m maze-
like VE with several interactable spherical objects, six workspaces,
and a task panel. The red spherical objects were equal-sized (radius
= 0.15 m) and marked with numbers. Workspaces were located at
six fixed positions with inactive or active states. Users cannot interact
with the inactive workspaces visualized, which is dark gray. Active
workspaces consisted of waiting and placement areas in translucent
gray and translucent blue, which would be used for the task (introduced
soon in the following section). This setting can effectively simulate
tasks that require users to operate simultaneously. For example, when
a user first finds a target object, he/she can place it in the waiting
area of a workspace and then observe/inquire about the other user’s
states and behaviors. Only when both users are ready can they start
the next operation, which is to place it in the placement area at the
same time. This process simulates the simultaneous operation of this
task state very well. Besides, the task panel was a large rectangular
plane to demonstrate the task specifications. The user’s avatar was a
cube (edge length = 0.25 m). The front side of the cube was in blue to
indicate the direction the avatar was looking at.
The test environment supports two types of locomotion. Users can
point and teleport far destinations using the Point & Teleport locomo-
tion technique [55] or naturally move around. As mentioned before,
the change of avatars representing two users will also be synchronously
shown in WIM and 2D Map. On the other hand, to simplify the test en-
vironment, When a user employs raycasting to direct attention towards
the sphere, the sphere will automatically orient itself to display the side
with the numerical label, ensuring that the label is conveniently visible
to the user. The object would return to its previous state when the ray
moved away. This feature was also extended to ExPI (as mentioned in
Section 3.2).
3.4. Task design
Each time participants entered the test environment, their avatars
and objects were instantiated at random positions. Meanwhile, the sys-
tem would activate two out of six workspaces and show two numbers
on the task panel.
Participants are required to complete a compound collaborative
task involving visual searching and object translation in the test en-
vironment. They must find the target objects with the given numbers
shown on the task panel and place them into the active workspaces
simultaneously and separately. Setting the task this way mainly aims
to simulate real-life scenarios where collaborators need to observe
the partner’s behavior while operating some items, such as assembly
training. When users are not co-located and visible to each other,
providing an external perspective to help them see the partner’s actions
in real-time would be more conducive to collaboration efficiency and
experience. In this case, the spatial awareness will be more important.
We want to explore the effect of exocentric perspective metaphors on
this type of collaborative task.
We had two designs to encourage collaboration and prevent ‘‘lon-
ers’’ from completing the task alone. First, the task required partici-
pants to put the target objects into the workspaces at the same time.
This forced the two participants to actively communicate with each
other and follow their partner’s actions promptly. Second, each active
workspace can only receive one object. The two participants had to
discuss which workspace they should go for. In our pilot tests, we
noticed that the participants who first got the target forgot to wait for
their partner and placed the objects directly. To avoid such a case, we
divided the workspace into an outer waiting area (in translucent gray)
and an inner placement area (in translucent blue) to give participants
explicit cues (see Fig. 1b). The participants who got the target faster
could wait at the waiting area and later put the object into the place-
ment area when the partner was ready. Overall, this task simplifies real
collaborative scenarios that require users to complete two sub-tasks in
parallel individually. For example, two users simultaneously click two
buttons to turn on a machine at different locations. In this case, users
must always consider their partner’s actions.
Specifically, each trial task consisted of the following steps: (1)
The system randomly showed two targets (denoted as T1 and T2) on
the task panel. Two workspaces (W1 and W2) became on-state for
participants to place the targets. (2) Two participants (P1 and P2) were
required to search the two target objects in the VR room, 2D Map, or
WIM. By communicating, they were asked to search for different targets
to finish the task quickly, for example, P1 for T1 and P2 for T2. (3)
When one target was found (e.g., T1) by one participant (e.g., P1), P1
needed to place T1 in the waiting area of one workspace (e.g., W1).
Then, P2 was asked to find T2 and place T2 in the waiting area of
the other workspace, W2. Before that, P2 needed to confirm which
one of the two workspaces had been used by P1. P2 can know this
by communicating with P1 or observing it on 2D Map and WIM if they
have one. (4) P1 would observe T2’s behavior. Once P1 saw that P2 was
also ready (placing T2 in the waiting area of W2), they communicated
to ask if they were prepared to move the targets into the placement
areas. For instance, T1 might say, ‘‘Are you ready?’’, ‘‘When I count
to ‘‘three’’, we simultaneously move them into placement areas, ok?’’.
By doing so, participants simultaneously moved two targets to the
placement areas. (5) When two targets were both in the placement
areas, two participants clicked a button in the controller to confirm it.
Then, one trial was finished, and the next one started (see Fig. 3).
4. User study
We conducted a user study to evaluate the performance and expe-
rience of using the ExPI to complete VR collaborative tasks against a
baseline condition without an ExPI. We aim to address the following
research questions (RQ):

Fig. 3. An example of all the steps involved in completing the given collaborative
tasks using WIM. (a) User A found ‘‘Object 3’’ and User B found ‘‘Object 7’’, the two
target objects specified on the task panel. (b) After negotiation, User A selected and
translated ‘‘Object 3’’ to the waiting area of the active workspace closest to her and
waited for User B. At the same time, User B was translating ‘‘Object 7’’ to another
active workspace. (c) User A and User B simultaneously placed the two targets in the
placement area of two active workspaces and confirmed the completion of the task.
• RQ1: How does the ExPI affect task performance, and how is its
usability in collaborative tasks with different complexities? The ExPI,
whether with WIM or 2D Map visualization variations, can sup-
port collaborative tasks. The WIM can help users complete tasks
faster because the users can interact with and control the interac-
tive 3D map intuitively. However, when the targets are very close
to the users, they might find it more convenient to manipulate
the object in VE directly than using the WIM. Besides, its effect
on task performance and users’ perceived usability is unclear,
especially at different difficulty levels.
• RQ2: How does the ExPI affect the social presence in VR collaborative
tasks? The ExPI, as an interactive interface, offers a distinctive
perspective for collaborative tasks in VR environments. By al-
lowing users to observe real-time information about their own
actions and those of their collaborators, it is expected that the
ExPI has the potential to enhance social presence, particularly the
co-presence among users within the VR environment.
• RQ3: How does the ExPI affect the VR sickness when completing
the VR collaborative tasks? VR sickness is generally induced when
moving in VR environments [56]. An ExPI helps users observe
and interact with the workspace remotely and keep updates on
collaborators’ states, which can potentially avoid frequent move-
ment and head turns in VEs. Thus, it is supposed to reduce VR
sickness in collaborative tasks.
4.1. Experiment design
This experiment followed a 3 × 3 within-subjects design with Tech-
nique (BL, 2D Map, and WIM) and Complexity (Simple, Medium, and
Fig. 4. One participant is observing details demonstrated in the (a) WIM, (b) 2D Map,
and (c) map in the BL condition.

Complex) as two independent variables. The order of Technique con-
ditions was counterbalanced using a Latin square design to minimize
learning effects. In each Technique condition, the order of Complexity was
randomized. There were 3 trails for each condition. In total, each pair
of participants needs to complete 27 trials (= 3 Technique × 3 Complexity
× 3 trials).
Firstly, we planned to compare the two ExPI (WIM and 2D Map)
with a BL (baseline) condition (see Fig. 4). For the Baseline (BL)
condition, participants were not provided with an ExPI but instead were
given a map of the VE (see Fig. 4c). This map was non-interactive
and did not display objects or users, resembling a traditional map that
depicts static terrain. Consequently, in the BL condition, participants
had to manually manipulate the targets and move in the VE to complete
each trial, as no assisting tools or clues were provided. In contrast,
participants in the WIM and 2D Map conditions could accomplish these
tasks using the ExPI. In short, we compare the use of ExPI (WIM and
2D Map) against its absence (Baseline).
Secondly, we wanted to evaluate the techniques with different en-
vironmental complexities. Thus, we set up three Complexity conditions:
Simple (10 objects with no occlusion), Medium (20 objects with partial
occlusion), and Complex (30 objects with full occlusion). We defined
task complexity in this way based on prior work [51].
Given that ExPIs primarily provide a top view, the occlusion only
occurred on the 𝑌-axis in our experimental design. That is, when the
coordinate values of the X and Z axes of two objects are the same, an
object would be occluded by those with larger 𝑌-axis values. In the
Simple condition, no occlusion happened to any of the 10 objects. In
the Medium condition, 20 objects were presented in the test environ-
ment, and half were partially occluded for 40% to 60% of their size.
The Complex condition involved 30 objects, half of which were fully
occluded. Fig. 5 demonstrates occlusion conditions from the top of the
test environment.
4.2. Participants
We recruited 36 participants (15 females, 21 males) aged 18 to
28 (𝑀= 21.83, 𝑆𝐷= 2.76) from a local university. Only two pairs
did not know each other before participating in the experiment. All
participants had normal or corrected vision, and none reported known
visual or vestibular disorders, such as color or night blindness. Eighteen
participants (50%) who used VR HMDs less than once per month
were not frequent VR users. The experiment was classified as low-risk
research and was approved by the University Ethics Committee. All
participants gave their consent to participate in the experiment.

4.3. Apparatus and setup
As shown in Fig. 6, two Meta Quest 2 VR HMDs were used for
the experiment. Quest 2’s display is RGB LCD 1832 × 1920 display
resolution per eye @ 90 Hz, and its FOV (Field of View) is 113.46◦
diagonally. They were connected to two desktop computers (Windows
10, 21H2) with an Intel Core i7-7700k CPU @ 2.9 GHz, 16 GB RAM,
and an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti GPU. The cables for connection
were long enough for the participants’ movements during the exper-
iment. The Quest 2 controllers were used as the input device. Users’
heads and hands were tracked in 6 DoF (Degrees of Freedom) by the
Quest 2 sensors to reproduce users’ physical actions in the virtual
environment via their avatars. The test environment and the techniques
were developed with Unity (version 2021.3.8f1c1) and Photon Unity
Networking (version 3.10).

The whole experiment took about one hour to complete for each
pair and involved 4 phases:
• Introduction (∼3 min): we informed participants of the exper-
iment’s goal and ethics regulations. Then, we asked them to
complete the consent form, a short questionnaire to collect de-
mographic data, and an SSQ about the user’s sickness level before
the experiment [56].
• Training (∼20 min): participants received several practice trials
to familiarize them with the VR device, techniques, controls, and
the task.
• Formal trials (∼35 min): participants completed the experimental
trials and filled in questionnaires after each condition. There was
a short break between the two conditions.
• Interview (∼3 min): we conducted a semi-structured interview to
collect further feedback and comments.
4.5. Measurements
The three techniques, BL, 2D Map, and WIM, were compared using
objective and subjective measurements.
• Completion Time: the completion time for each trial was recorded
in a system log file to measure task performance (RQ1). In each
trial, the completion time was defined as the time from the task
panel showing a task till both participants clicked the button to
confirm they completed the task.
• System Usability Scale (SUS) [57]: we used a SUS questionnaire
to measure the usability of the interface (RQ1). SUS consists
of 10 items on a 5-point Likert scale (1: Strongly Disagree ∼5:
Strongly Agree). Based on the ratings, we calculated the overall
SUS scores [57] (ranging from 0 to 100) and used them for
analysis. The higher the SUS score, the higher the perceived
usability.
• Social Presence Questionnaire [58]: the NMM (Networked Minds
Measure) Social Presence Questionnaire [58] was used to measure
social presence (RQ2). The questionnaire contains nine 7-scale
items (1: Strongly Disagree ∼7: Strongly Agree). The results from
the questionnaire are further summarized into three sub-scores:
Co-Presence (CP), Attention Allocation (AA), and Perceived Mes-
sage Understanding (PMU). In addition, we also calculated the
Overall score. The results also show that the higher, the better.
• Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ) [56]: we used the SSQ to
measure VR sickness (RQ3). SSQ is used to determine how severe
users’ VR sickness symptoms are. It asks participants to provide
subjective severity ratings of 16 symptoms on a scale from 0 (no
perception) to 3 (severe perception) after exposure to VR. The
ratings were further processed to output four sub-scales: Nausea
(SSQ-N), Oculomotor (SSQ-O), Disorientation (SSQ-D), and Total
Severity (SSQ-TS).
• User Experience Ratings: we also asked participants to rate the
techniques in terms of collaborative experience (CE), that is,
their satisfaction with using the given technique to complete the
collaboration task (1: Very Unsatisfied ∼7: Very Satisfied). In
addition, we also asked participants about the ease of use of the
technique (EU)—how difficult they felt using the given technique
to complete the task [59] (1: Very Easy ∼7: Very Difficult).2
• Preference and Feedback: at the end of the experiment, participants
were asked to choose the most preferred technique for each
condition and provide feedback regarding their experience with
each technique.
Besides the above measures, we recorded participants’ behaviors
and communications during collaboration (how pairs in each condition
tended to work together and interact with each technique).
5. Results
In this section, we report the results, starting with the objective
measures—completion time (Section 5.1), followed by subjective rat-
ings collected from questionnaires (Sections 5.2 to 5.5).
We applied two-way repeated-measure Analysis of Variance tests
(short as RM-ANOVA hereafter) for completion time and SUS scores
to compare the effects of Technique and Complexity. Shapiro–Wilk tests
showed that both completion time and SUS scores were normally
distributed (𝑝> .05). We set significance level 𝛼to .05 and applied
Bonferroni corrections to post hoc pairwise comparisons. In addition,
Greenhouse–Geisser adjustments were used to adjust the degrees of
freedom when the sphericity assumption was violated, and effect sizes
(𝜂2
𝑝) were reported whenever feasible.
For the data collected from the social presence questionnaire, SSQ,
and user experience ratings that were ordinal, not normally distributed,
and only compared among Technique conditions, we applied non-
parametric Friedman tests. Post hoc analysis was conducted using
Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with Bonferroni corrections. 𝑀, 𝑆𝐷, and
𝑀𝑑𝑛are short for mean, standard deviation, and median, respectively.

and Table 1.
Pairwise comparisons showed that WIM led to a significantly shorter
completion time than 2D Map and BL for all Complexity conditions (all
𝑝< .001). Also, 2D Map was significantly faster than BL (𝑝< .001 for
Simple and Medium, and 𝑝= .037 for Complex).
Besides, BL took significantly less time to complete trials in Simple
tasks than in Medium (𝑝= .028) and Complex tasks (𝑝= .002).
Similarly, 2D Map took significantly less time in Simple tasks than in
Medium (𝑝= .006) and Complex (𝑝< .001) tasks and significantly
less time in Medium tasks than in Complex tasks (𝑝= .001). Finally,
WIM took significantly less time in Simple and Medium tasks than in
Complex trials (both 𝑝< .001).
5.2. System Usability Scale (SUS)
Fig. 8 and Table 2 summarize the SUS results. Results from RM-
ANOVA showed a significant main effect of Technique (𝐹2,70 = 105.303,
𝑝< .001, 𝜂2
𝑝= .751), a significant main effect of Complexity (𝐹1.209,42.310

𝑝= .463), and a significant interaction effect on
SUS scores (𝐹1.898,66.436 = 5.126, 𝑝= .010, 𝜂2
𝑝= .128). Post hoc pairwise
comparisons revealed that for all Complexity conditions, WIM obtained
a significantly higher score than 2D Map and BL, and 2D Map got a
significantly higher score than BL (all 𝑝< .001).
When using BL to complete the given tasks, it was rated better in
Simple tasks than in Medium and Complex tasks and better in Medium
tasks than in Complex tasks (all 𝑝< .001). 2D Map got higher scores in
Simple tasks than in Medium (𝑝= .001) and Complex (𝑝< .001) tasks
and a higher score in Medium tasks than Complex tasks (𝑝= .002).
As for WIM, it got a higher score in Simple and Medium tasks than in
Complex tasks (𝑝= .007 and .021, respectively).

Friedman test showed that there was a significant difference in Overall
scores among the three techniques (𝜒2(2) = 66.526, 𝑝< .001). Post
hoc Wilcoxon signed-rank tests revealed that WIM (𝑀𝑑𝑛= 5.70) was
rated significantly higher than 2D Map (𝑀𝑑𝑛= 4.70; 𝑝< .001) and
BL (𝑀𝑑𝑛= 2.95; 𝑝< .001). Additionally, 2D Map scored significantly
higher than BL (𝑝< .001).
Friedman tests yielded significant main effects of Technique on CP
(𝜒2(2) = 60.941, 𝑝< .001), AA (𝜒2(2) = 31.581, 𝑝< .001), and
PMU (𝜒2(2) = 57.662, 𝑝< .001). Post hoc analysis revealed that WIM
was rated significantly higher than 2D Map and BL, and 2D Map was
significantly higher than BL for all three sub-scales (all 𝑝< .001).
Table 3 summarizes the results.
5.4. Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ)
Fig. 10 and Table 3 demonstrate the results in SSQ. Results from
Friedman tests showed that there were significant effects of Technique
on SSQ-N (𝜒2(2) = 16.021, 𝑝< .001), SSQ-O (𝜒2(2) = 15.942, 𝑝<
.001), SSQ-D (𝜒2(2) = 12.923, 𝑝= .002), and SSQ-TS (𝜒2(2) = 17.802,
𝑝< .001).
Regarding the total severity (SSQ-TS), post hoc tests showed that
WIM (𝑀𝑑𝑛= 0.00) induced less VR sickness than 2D Map (𝑀𝑑𝑛=
14.96, 𝑝< .001) and BL (𝑀𝑑𝑛= 13.09, 𝑝< .001). For SSQ-N, post
hoc tests showed that WIM (𝑀𝑑𝑛= 0.00) induced significantly lower
nauseating sensation than 2D Map (𝑀𝑑𝑛= 9.54) and BL (𝑀𝑑𝑛= 4.77)
(both p <.001). For SSQ-O, WIM (𝑀𝑑𝑛= 0.00) was rated significantly
lower than 2D Map (𝑀𝑑𝑛= 7.58, 𝑝= .001) and BL (𝑀𝑑𝑛= 7.58, 𝑝<

SSQ-D, WIM (𝑀𝑑𝑛= 0.00) was rated significantly lower than 2D Map
(𝑀𝑑𝑛= 13.92, 𝑝< .001) and BL (𝑀𝑑𝑛= 13.92, 𝑝= .003), indicating
a lower sense of disorientation. No significant difference between 2D

5.5. User experience, preference, and feedback
Friedman tests showed significant main effects of Technique on the
CE (𝜒2(2) = 72.000, 𝑝< .001) and EU (𝜒2(2) = 71.042, 𝑝< .001).
Post hoc analysis with Wilcoxon signed-rank tests revealed that WIM
was rated significantly higher than 2D Map and BL, and 2D Map also
got significantly higher scores than BL for both items (all 𝑝< .001). The
results indicate that participants felt WIM and 2D Map were better than
BL regarding collaborative experience and ease of use. Between the two
interfaces, WIM provided a better experience than BL. The results were
summarized in Table 3.
We asked participants to choose the most preferred technique for
each Complexity condition based on their preference. The preferences
for Simple and Medium were similar, while the preference for the
Complex condition was completely one-sided. For the Simple condition,
3 participants (8.33%) ranked BL as the most favored technique, 9
voted for 2D Map (25%), and 24 voted for WIM (66.67%). For the
Medium condition, 2 participants (5.56%) voted BL as the most favored
technique, 5 voted for 2D Map (13.89%), and 24 voted for WIM
(80.56%). Meanwhile, for the Complex condition, all 36 participants
preferred to use WIM. In the next section, we discussed our observa-
tions during the experiments and all other feedback collected from the
interview.
6. Discussion
In this research, we explored the effects of two ExPIs, WIM, and
2D Map, for VR collaborative tasks with different levels of task com-
plexity (Simple, Medium, and Complex). Overall, the results showed
that the ExPIs benefited from the collaboration. We next discuss the
findings in more detail combined with experimental observations and
communications of participants.
6.1. Answers to the research questions
Results showed that using an ExPI for VR collaborative tasks yielded
significantly higher efficiency and usability than not using one (i.e.,
baseline) for tasks with different complexities (RQ1). The results sup-
ported our H1. Also, WIM (3D exocentric perspective) performed better
than 2D Map (2D exocentric perspective) in terms of task efficiency,
usability, and VR sickness mitigation. Significant differences existed in
completion time between Medium (partial occlusion) and Complex (full
occlusion) conditions for 2D Map, but not for WIM and BL. These results
supported our H2.
We inferred that the occlusion issues would be more obvious for
the 2D Map because of its 2D view, which would greatly influence the
task performance. Besides, there were similar findings for the perceived
usability—the simpler the task was, the higher the perceived usability,
which helps explain the significant reduction in task completion time
between Complex and Simple trials. Some participants mentioned that
they only found the difference between Simple and Complex conditions
and between Simple and Medium conditions, but not for Complex and
Medium conditions. One possible reason is that the difference between
partial and full occlusion is limited. While occlusion occurs in the
VE, it makes the task more complex than without occlusion in visual
searching and object translation tasks in a VR collaborative scenario.
Based on these results, WIM was more effective and useful for VR
collaborative tasks involving visual searching and object manipulation,
especially when the objects are partially or fully occluded. A 2D Map
is also efficient and useful compared to a baseline case; however, it
introduces ambiguity when the objects overlap and are viewed from
the top.
In our study, the primary function of ExPIs is to offer real-time
awareness of collaborators’ activities, enabling basic operational sup-
port. Although it could handle some basic operations, our experimental
focus is on promoting efficient and smooth team collaboration rather
than pursuing highly complex control operations. Our aim is to create
a simple and easy-to-use tool to supplement rather than replace direct
operations. In this work, due to the relatively straightforward task,
which only involves placing the target object in the designated work
area, the experiment does not cover the steps that require more precise
operations. Therefore, we did not particularly emphasize the accuracy
Displays 84 (2024) 102781 
8 
L. Chen et al.
issues caused by subtle differences in actions under different experi-
mental conditions. In situations where precise operation is required,
on-site direct operation will likely have advantages. Considering this, in
our future work, we will consider adding more functionalities to ExPIs
to allow it to support more complex tasks, such as zoom-in-out function-
ality for specific regions, making it a more effective supplementary tool
for direct operations. At the same time, we will consider operational
accuracy as an additional evaluation indicator. In this way, we can
better understand the performance of ExPIs under different operational
requirements to further optimize their functions and allow them to
adapt to a wider range of collaborative needs.
The frequency of interaction can serve as an indicator of a user’s
workload and the ease of use of the implemented interaction method.
Our observations of participants’ behaviors revealed that the WiM and
the 2D Map might necessitate more recurrent adjustments due to orien-
tation manipulation, possibly leading to a higher number of interactions
compared to the baseline condition. The 2D Map, however, confronts
challenges with object occlusion and navigating a two-dimensional
projection of a three-dimensional space. Consequently, we observed
increased interactions among participants as they addressed occlusion
problems. Conversely, the baseline condition could facilitate more di-
rect manipulation, potentially resulting in a distinct interaction pattern.
Moreover, individual participants exhibited diverse strategies, such
as swiftly scanning the scene, meticulously inspecting each object,
relocating nonessential items from their field of view, or momentarily
releasing and re-grasping targets to enhance precision and accuracy.
These observations indicate that interaction frequency could impact
user experience. Thus, future research should contemplate incorpo-
rating interaction frequency as an ancillary metric to offer a more
comprehensive evaluation of efficiency and user experience across
various interaction modalities.
Compared to the baseline condition, both ExPIs received higher
scores on all social presence sub-scales and supported the collaboration
in our study setup (RQ2). The results also supported our H1. We
found that WIM received significantly higher ratings than 2D Map
on overall social presence scores and all sub-scales between the two
interfaces. This supported our H2. The results suggest that WIM with
a 3D exocentric perspective allows users to observe the operations and
behavior intentions of the collaborator more accurately. By contrast,
a 2D map only provides the movement on a plane (X–Z plane in our
study), which may not show changes so clearly as in WIM. Participants’
communication during collaboration also confirmed this point. When
using the 2D Map, we observed that despite the collaborator’s manipu-
lation of the target, some participants still verbally inquired about the
status of the task. For instance, questions such as ‘‘Have you found the
target?’’ and ‘‘Have you put it in the waiting area?’’ were frequently
asked, indicating a reliance on verbal communication to confirm the
progress of the collaboration. This suggests that, even when visual cues
and the spatial awareness provided by the 2D Map were available,
participants still found it beneficial to verbally confirm information.
In contrast, we did not observe similar verbal inquiries in the WIM
condition. This indicates that the non-verbal feedback and implicit
communication provided by WIM might have been sufficient for the
participants to assess the status of the task without the need for explicit
verbal confirmation. This finding suggests that the design of WIM might
have facilitated a more implicit and efficient form of collaboration,
reducing the need for explicit verbal communication. While visual cues
and spatial awareness can provide valuable information, they might not
always be sufficient, and explicit verbal communication can still play
a crucial role. On the other hand, interfaces like WIM that provide
implicit feedback might promote a more efficient and natural form
of collaboration, reducing the cognitive load associated with explicit
communication. In the BL condition, the absence of spatial awareness
cues significantly altered the nature of participant interactions. With-
out the visual aids provided by the WIM and 2D Map, participants
were forced to rely almost exclusively on verbal communication to
coordinate their actions. Participants frequently asked questions like
‘‘Where are you?’’, ‘‘Are you ready?’’, and ‘‘Can we put them into the
placement area now?’’ to establish a shared understanding of their
relative positions and readiness to proceed. Additionally, there is a need
to explicitly verify workspace locations, as can be seen from questions
such as ‘‘Is it the one in the upper right corner?’’ or ‘‘Is it the one in
the middle when facing the task panel?’’. These observations further
underscored the importance of considering both explicit and implicit
communication channels in collaborative VR environments. Based on
the results, we can conclude that users can see the operations and
positions of all avatars with an ExPI, which provides a significantly
stronger feeling of being connected and helps them better understand
their collaborator’s actions and intentions. In addition, WIM is more
beneficial for providing spatial awareness and a sense of co-presence,
as shown in Section 5.3. For the 2D Map, participants commented that
noticing small changes, including users’ operations and movements,
was not obvious, resulting in a lower sense of social presence.
We found that WIM significantly reduced VR sickness in the tasks
compared to the 2D Map and BL conditions (RQ3). The results sup-
ported our H2. We did not find a significant difference between 2D
Map and BL on VR sickness. This did not support our H1. Participants’
behaviors during the experiment can help explain these results. With
WIM, participants could find the target objects and translate them
to the target workspace with fewer or even no movements and head
turns; thus, it significantly mitigated the VR sickness. However, when
using a 2D Map, participants may need to move around frequently for
disambiguation.
Regarding collaborative experience, participants also expressed a
preference for WIM. They thought WIM was easier to use than 2D
Map and BL. Besides, 2D Map got higher ratings in collaborative
experience and ease-of-use scores than BL. We also found that they
always preferred WIM regardless of task complexity levels. The more
complex the scenarios, the more participants preferred WIM.
Overall, our H1 was partially supported and H2 was fully supported.
Providing an ExPI is recommended for enhancing spatial awareness
and improving usability and task efficiency. Specifically, WIM, a 3D
interactive exocentric interface used in this study, is particularly helpful
when completing visual searching and manipulation tasks in collabora-
tive VR. When few objects are in scenes, and the occlusion issue is not
severe, 2D Map can also provide collaborative aids.
6.2. Design implications
Based on the results of our user study, we distilled the following
design implications (DI) for future collaborative VR systems:
• DI1: An ExPI can enhance the sense of social presence and col-
laborative experience for VR collaboration. It provides explicit
spatial awareness cues to users. Users can notice each other’s state
in a timely.
• DI2: An ExPI enables rapid interaction during VR collaboration.
With an ExPI, users can interact with the elements in the VE
remotely, simplifying the task and mitigating VR sickness.
• DI3: WIM and 2D Map are recommended for the simple complex-
ity collaborative VE. When the environment becomes complex,
such as having a large number of interfering objects and the target
object is fully occluded, a WIM-type technique is more usable,
given its higher disambiguation capability.
6.3. Limitations and future work
We identified the following limitations from our research, which
could serve as directions for future work. Firstly, we used a simplified
collaborative task for experimental purposes. Future work could be
conducted to evaluate the ExPIs in the field and examine their use
in different collaboration scenarios. Secondly, to remove confounding
Displays 84 (2024) 102781 
9 
L. Chen et al.
variables, we used unified spherical objects and avatars in the test envi-
ronment. ExPIs can be more useful in a high-fidelity test environment.
For example, if users’ hand and arm movements are rendered in the test
environment and observable via ExPIs, users can see their collaborators’
actions more clearly. In addition, to obtain a better understanding of
users’ specific interaction patterns, our follow-up work will include
additional related metrics, such as interaction frequency and users’
perceived workload.
In the future, we also plan to explore VR scenes on a larger scale. In
these more complicated spaces with more items, users may need more
time and effort to adapt and interact with ExPI. We want to add scalable
features for ExPIs (e.g., Scaled Scrolling Worlds in Miniature [16]),
which allows for dynamic adjustment of the WIM size. Besides, the
interaction methods within WIM, including controller raycasting and
gesture-supported drag-and-drop, are crucial topics worthy of further
exploration. Furthermore, gaze analysis was not included in our study.
It could provide additional insights into users’ visual attention pat-
terns [61,62], and incorporating gaze data could be beneficial in future
studies. Finally, comparing communication patterns and strategies in
cooperative and competitive tasks is intriguing. Understanding the
nuances and differences in communication behaviors across different
VR interactions will offer valuable insights.
7. Conclusion
In this paper, we evaluated two Exocentric Perspective Interfaces
(ExPIs), World In Miniature (WIM) and 2D Map, on task performance,
system usability, social presence, and VR sickness for collaboration
tasks in Virtual Reality (VR). A user study compared them against
a baseline condition with Simple, Medium, and Complex levels of
task complexity. The study followed a within-subjects design (i.e., 3
techniques × 3 task complexities) with 18 pairs of participants. Based
on the results, we found that the two ExPIs improved collaboration
performance and experience. Specifically, WIM performed better than
2D Map on task efficiency. Users were more positive about the usability
of WIM than 2D Map, especially in complex tasks. We also found that
both ExPIs were useful for enhancing the sense of social presence and
user experience when completing visual searching and manipulation
tasks. Finally, WIM induced less VR sickness compared to 2D Map
and baseline. Overall, we conclude that WIM and 2D Map are benefi-
cial when completing visual searching and collaborative manipulation
tasks. WIM is particularly useful when the collaborative environment
is complex. Overall, ExPIs are useful in enhancing collaborative tasks
in VR and should be provided in such scenarios.
